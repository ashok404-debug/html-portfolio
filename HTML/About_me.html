      <p>Hi there!</p>
      <p>
        I'm Ashok Budhathoki, a fun-loving and curious soul who enjoys exploring
        new things and embracing creativity in every form. Whether it's diving
        into a captivating book, listening to soothing music, or traveling to
        new places, I find joy in life's little adventures.
      </p>

        Recently, I've embarked on an exciting journey of coding, and I'm
        absolutely loving it! The thrill of creating something from scratch
        keeps me motivated to learn and improve every day. It feels like
        unlocking a whole new world of possibilities! It's challenging,
        exciting, and incredibly rewarding.
      </p>

        When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll probably find me editing
        photos, sketching something cool, or experimenting with some graphic
        designs. People often say I'm friendly, easygoing, and full of positive vibes,
        and I take that to heart. I believe life is all about learning,
        laughing, and sharing moments with others, so I'm always up for new
        experiences and collaborations.
      </p>

        This portfolio is a reflection of my passions, skills, and the journey
        I'm on as a developer-in-progress and a creative enthusiast. I'm excited
        to keep learning, growing, and making things that inspire. Feel free to
        explore my work hereâ€”and if you'd like to connect or collaborate, I'd
        love to hear from you!!
